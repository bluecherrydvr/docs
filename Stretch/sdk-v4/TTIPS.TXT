Troubleshooting tips
--------------------

- Depending on which board you have purchased, it may have a disk
  drive connector on it. If it does, this must be connected from
  the power supply. The board draws its power from this connector
  and will not boot if the connector is not hooked up.

- Make sure that the DIP switches on the board are set correctly.
  See the Quick Start Guide for the correct settings.

- If the dvrcp.exe demo application cannot find your board, go
  to the Windows Device Manager and make sure that Windows has
  configured the board properly. Right-click the "My Computer"
  icon on your desktop, select "Manage", then select "Device
  Manager". If the Stretch S6 DVR board is not listed in the
  device tree, right-click and select "Scan for hardware changes".
  If this still does not show the board, try rebooting the PC.

- If the board is still not visible in the Device Manager, make
  sure that the board is booting properly by connecting the UART
  cable from the debug module to a PC. When the PC with the board
  installed is powered on, you should see several lines of text 
  printed out by the board as it boots. Make sure these appear and
  that there are no error messages. If you see any error messages,
  contact your Stretch representative for assistance.

- If the board is visible in the Device Manager and is reported
  as working properly, but is still not detected by dvrcp.exe,
  try disabling the board (right-click on the board in Device
  Manager and select "Disable") and then re-enabling it.

- Run the board diagnostic program provided with the kit. See the
  Quick Start Guide for details on how to do this.

- Make sure that you are not trying to load the diagnostic ROM file
  to the board. The diagnostic ROM file can be used only by the
  command line diagnostic tool.

- Make sure you are not trying to load an incorrect version of the
  firmware to  the board through the demo application.

- Make sure that the boot loader, PCI driver, ROM file, and dvrcp.exe
  are all from the same release.
