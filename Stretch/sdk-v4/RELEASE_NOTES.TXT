	Release Notes for Stretch PCIe DVR Development Kit
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Changes in Release 5.0.0
-------------------------

This release adds the following new features:

- Support for PowerPC platforms. Only the FreeScale MPC8315 and MPC8377
processors have been tested. For other PowerPC platform support, please
contact your Stretch support person. NOTE: The dvrcp demo application is
not supported on PowerPC platforms.

- Windows Vista is fully supported in this release.

- The Stretch VCC6416 16-channel capture card is now supported as a beta
release.

- Stretch host-based H.264 decoder/player.
  - Host side H.264 decoder library based on ffmpeg.
  - Windows-based player to play back H.264 video and audio from a
    recorded file.

- Cascaded SMO: This feature is only supported for boards that have the
capability to support analog SMO output and also have cascade capability.
This feature provides the ability to reroute SMO output from one DVR board
to be displayed on the SMO output of another DVR board.

- The MPEG4 encoder has been improved in quality and reliability.

A. Firmware
-----------

Several bugs have been fixed.

B. Demo Application
-------------------

No feature changes.

NOTE: The raw video display quality on HMO may not look sharp when using 
      VCC6416 card. The reason is that the default values used in DVRCP 
      for Hue, Saturation, Brightness, and Contrast are so that the picture 
      frame quality is sharp on VRC6016 or VRC6016C cards. You can correct
      this problem by changing these parameters from the video-in tab in 
      the "Camera Properties" dialog box within DVRCP. Refer to the Stretch
      technical notes for best values to be used in these fields.

C. SDK
------

No feature changes.


Changes in Release 4.1.0
------------------------

This release adds the following new features:

- Support for new video resolutions:

  + "classic" 4CIF (640x480)
  + "classic" 2CIF (640x240)
  + "classic" CIF  (320x240)

These resolutions are supported for HMO display (raw video) only.
They are not supported for encoding and SMO output.

- Support for enabling and disabling video deinterlacing.

- Support for enabling and disabling video noise reduction filtering.
  (Stretch-lateral).

- Support for adjusting gain on any camera input (if supported by
  the board hardware).

- Support for setting camera termination impedance.
  (if supported by the board hardware).

- New Spot Monitor Out (SMO) features: (if supported by the board)

  + Two lines of OSD text are supported on each SMO display.

  + Video frames supplied by the host can be displayed on the SMO
    output, if the SMO port supports video output.

- API calls to turn various LEDs on and off on the boards. The specific
  LED types are board-dependent.
  
- API calls to read/write any register on the video input devices.

- Support of MJPEG recording in .mov format by the low-level AVMUX APIs.

- Extended watchdog timer functionality to specify the timeout value.


A. Firmware
-----------

- The firmware now provides IOCTL calls to read or write any register on
  the video input devices. All Techwell/Nextchip registers can be accessed
  in this way.
  
- The raw video output format from the firmware has changed. The video is
  now delivered in planar YUV or YVU format, with the planes contiguous in
  memory, and a single data header instead of one per plane. A new IOCTL
  command allows selecting the output format.
  
- Privacy blocking now works for all video resolutions.

- The 2CIF resolutions do not support OSD fully. It is recommended that
  OSD not be used when 2CIF video is enabled.
  
- Privacy blocking cannot be disabled. To remove privacy blocking, the
  privacy region must be cleared.

A. Firmware
-----------

- The firmware now includes a simple resource control manager. This
will reject attempts to create more than the supported number of
encoders or decoders per chip.

- The firmware now provides frame sequence numbers for raw video and
encoded frames. The PCI header structure has changed to accomodate
this and other changes.

- 2CIF HMO display does not support privacy blocking. The SMO display
and the encoded video will honor the privacy blocking settings.


B. Demo application
-------------------

- GUI-based support for setting/changing all video-in image properties: 
  Brightness, Contrast, Hue, Saturation, and Sharpness.

- Added capabilities to clear or restrict updating of the log window.

- Added support to graphically specify the Regions of Interest (ROI)
  For different alarm detections and privacy blocking.

- Support of 2CIF for HMO display.
 
- HMO panel displays in 4:3 aspect ratio.

- Support to record to a new file every time instead of
  overwriting the same file.

------

- Support to allow changing of video frame decimation while
  the encoder is enabled. 

- Data Structures updated/removed/added
  + sdvr_board_e		Removed.
  + sdvr_board_attrib_t		Updated.

Now the board type 32-bit integer the hi-16 bits is subsystem
vendor and low-16 bits is device ID.

  + sdvr_chan_def_t		Updated.

The field video_size is removed. You no longer need to specify
a video size when creating a decoder channel. Instead you can
call sdvr_set_decoder_size() prior enabling the decoder
to set the size of recorded frame to be decoded.

  + sdvr_image_ctrl_t		New.

  + sdvr_video_enc_chan_params_t  Some field ranges are changed.

GOP size of zero currently not supported.
H.264 & MPEG4 quality field range is changed from 0-100 to 1-100.
MJPEG quality field range is changed from 10-300 to 1-99.

  + sdvr_mb_region_t		New

  + sdvr_av_buffer_t		Updated - New fields added.
  + sdvr_yuv_buffer_t		Updated - New fields added.

Various informational field are added to these two data 
Structures (i.e., the width and lines of a video frame).
Also starting this version it is strongly recommended not
to access these fields directly instead use the new frame
buffer field access APIs.

- Functions updated

  + sdvr_get_driver_version()	Added a new parameters.

This function is fixed to return correctly the PCI driver
version for the requested DVR board number.

  + sdvr_set_video_encoder_channel_params().

Allow changing of the encoder decimation while the encoder
is enabled.

- Functions Removed

  + sdvr_get_firmware_version()	Use sdvr_get_firmware_version_ex().

  + sdvr_get_osd_text()		Use sdvr_osd_text_config_ex()
  + sdvr_enable_osd_text()	Use sdvr_osd_text_show()

- Functions Added

  + sdvr_set_regions_map()
  + sdvr_set_regions()
  + sdvr_motion_value_analyzer()
  + sdvr_set_motion_value_frequency()
  + sdvr_get_alarm_motion_value()
  + sdvr_enable_motion_detection_ex()

  + sdvr_set_decoder_size()

  + sdvr_get_buffer_timestamp()
  + sdvr_get_buffer_frame_type()
  + sdvr_get_buffer_sub_encoder()
  + sdvr_get_buffer_alarm_value()
  + sdvr_av_buf_video_dimensions()
  + sdvr_av_buf_sequence()
  + sdvr_av_buf_payload()
  + sdvr_av_buf_yuv_payload()

  + sdvr_get_video_in_params()

Using these two function you can get or set following video in 
Image properties: 
   
   Brightness, Contrast, Hue, Saturation, and Sharpness.

  + sdvr_enable_auth_key()

If you set an authentication key on the DVR board, you can enable
this feature to record authentication information with the encoded
video stream. The video file can be authenticated using the
authentication verifier. Contact your Technical Support engineer
for details of how to set the key and use the verifier tools.


E. UI SDK
---------

- New API sdvr_ui_set_preview_callback() to allow drawing
over live video.
   

F. Limitations for this release
-------------------------------

- A video file recorded with multiple resolutions can not be played 
  back by the Demo Application.
  
- .MOV files recorded with authentication enabled cannot be played
back correctly by Quicktime versions later than 7.4.5. This is a
problem with Quicktime.

- Disconnecting and reconnecting a camera in the Demo application
can cause the audio to become disabled. If this happens then the
audio will have to be re-enabled manually.

- Unchecking the "Live Update" option in the Video Input Settings
dialog box can cause changed settings to not get applied properly.
It is recommended that the option be kept enabled.

- Currently privacy blocking cannot be disabled in the firmware.
To remove privacy blocking, the regions must be cleared. This will be
fixed in a later release.

- In the demo application, if you create a new empty configuration for
PAL mode, then create cameras, the default HMO frame rate gets set to
30. This frame rate is rejected by the firmware if you attempt to 
connect the camera to an input port. The workaround is to manually
verify that the HMO (raw video) frame rate is set appropriately.

  was changed from sdvr_board_e to sx_uint32. The board type 
  is combination of device_id and the subsystem_vendor.
  
- A new data structure sdvr_pci_attrib_t is added. This data
  structure include the PCIe device related information as 
  well as the serial number on the DVR board. These information
  can be retrieved by calling sdvr_get_pci_attrib() at any time,
  even before any coded is loaded onto the DVR board.
  
- The maximum value of enc_buf_num field in sdvr_sdk_params_t is
  limited to 40.

  can be retrieved by calling sdvr_get_board_attributes().

- A hi-level recording support is added to the SDK by calling
  sdvr_start_recording() to start recording to a file and
  sdvr_stop_recording(). 
  NOTE: These functions are in alpha phase and maybe changed
  or removed in the future release of the SDK.
  
- For the MS Windows enviornment you can choose to link with the
  SDVR SDK dynamically or statically. For dynamic linking of the
  SDK, you link your application with sdvr_sdk_dll.lib and

    closed properly due to power failure or application
    crash.
  + Supports to extended testing of decoder by
    changing the continuous playback of an encoded file
    to only reset the file while the decoder never
    gets disabled.

- Supports for watchdog timer. By enabling the watchdog
  timer from the system dialogbox, dvrcp.exe sends a
  heart beat message every 5 seconds to the firmware .
  From the "Tools" menu, you can force the watchdog timer 
  to expire by disabling the sending of the heart beat messages.

SDK
---

- Enhancements to OSD text.
  + Font selection. You can either down load .bdf file
    or use the default system English font to be used
    for OSD text. A new function sdvr_osd_set_font_table()
    allows you to download a .bdf file to the firmware.
    After you downloaded a custom font you can switch
    between the system font or the custom font by calling
    sdvr_osd_use_font_table().
  + Maximum of two OSD text of up to 100 unsigned Unicode
    characters can be assigned to each encoder of a camera.
    A new function sdvr_osd_text_config_ex() is added to
    allow specifying of Unicode OSD text. The display status
    for each OSD text is controlled by the new function
    sdvr_osd_text_show().
    The old OSD calls sdvr_set_osd_text(),sdvr_get_osd_text, and
    sdvr_enable_osd_text() should be used when communicating with
    firmware version prior to 3.2.0.0.
 
    Note: The old and new OSD functions can not be mixed together.
 
- Support for user defined data per each channel. You can add
  and retrieve any 64 bit data to any channel handle using two
  new functions sdvr_set_chan_user_data() and sdvr_get_chan_user_data().
 
- Support for firmware error message signals. The firmware now
  sends asynchronous signals messages as it detects errors.
  These messages can be accessed by registering a signal callback
  function using sdvr_set_signals_callback(). Currently the
  only two supported messages are firmware error detections
  (SDVR_SIGNAL_RUNTIME_ERROR and SDVR_SIGNAL_FATAL_ERROR).
 
- Support for extended version reporting. Starting with version 3.2.0.0
  Stretch supports four part version scheme for all of its version
  reporting APIs. This change affects existing sdvr_get_sdk_version(),
  sdvr_get_drvier_version(), sdvr_get_firmware_version() functions
  which either only supported one part or 3 part version scheme.
  Additionally, a new function sdvr_get_firmware_version_ex() function
  is added which in addition to the firmware version, it reports
  the firmware build date, bootloader and BSP versions.
 
- Support for reporting DVR board type and chip revision –
  sdvr_get_board_attributes() is extended to report the current
  board type and chip revision.
 
- Support for 64 bit timestamps on A/V buffers. sdvr_av_buffer_t supports 64 bit
  timestamps when connected to firmware version 3.2.0.0 or higher.

- Changing any of the SMO properties will not affect
  recording on the same camera any more. Although it
  will stop and restart the SMO streaming.

- NTSC QCIF frame size is changed from 176x120 to 176x112.
 
- Supports for RS485 communication. Three APIs sdvr_init_uart(),
  sdvr_write_uart, and sdvr_read_uart() are added to initialize,
  send character bytes, and read character bytes on RS485 port.

- Supports for watchdog timer. The DVR Application should call
  sdvr_set_watchdog_state() every 5 seconds to prevent the watchdog
  timer from expiring while the watchdog timer is enabled. The
  current state of watchdog timer can be retrieved by calling
  sdvr_get_watchdog_state().

- Changing of any of the encoder properties while encoder is
  enabled will not cause any frame drops due to stopping and
  restarting of the encoder.

- Changing of the video resolution parameter while encoder is
  enabled is not allowed.

- The function sdvr_board_connect() has a new parameter which 
  controls the h.264 start code emulation processing.

Limitations for this release
----------------------------

- Analog switch SMO only allows displaying of one camera at a time.

- Digital SMO provides multiple tiles for different camera output
  but limits to 15 input cameras. Additionally, there can not be
  any duplicate of camera output in any SMO tiles.

- No detailed error message is provided if mixed video standard
  cameras are connected to a DVR board.
 
- Number of OSD text per camera encoding is limited to two.

- No MJPEG A/V frame support for recording into mp4 file format.

- DVRCP can not save none-ASCII characters into the configuration
  file.

Changes in Release 3.1.0
------------------------

This release fixes a bug that could cause corruption of
the encoded video bitstream.

Changes in Release 3.0
----------------------

This release adds the following new features:

- Dual stream recording. Each camera can now support two
  recorded streams, each one of which can be in any of the
  supported formats. Properties for each stream can be set
  independently.

- Audio recording is now supported.

- The H.264 decoder is now fully functional. It also supports
  post-processing functions such as motion detection on the
  decoded picture.

- MPEG4 encoding is supported. IMPORTANT: The MPEG4 encoder is
  an alpha release and is not production quality.

- The demo application has added several new features to make
  it easier to use.

- Many bugs have been fixed in the firmware, PCI driver, and SDK.

Demo application
----------------

- When creating a new system, you can choose to either start with
  a "Blank configuration" or an "Encoder configuration" which 
  contains 16 H.264 cameras with audio enabled.

- You can limit the size of mp4 recoding from the system dialog box
  in the settings tab. Once the maximum number of frames allowed is
  reached the recording will automatically stop and restart again.

- An audio tab is added to the property page of any camera with 
  Audio encoder enabled. Currently no information in this tab can
  be changed. This tab is grayed out if the audio encoding is 
  disabled for this camera.

- At the time of creating a new camera, you have the option of
  selecting a secondary video encoding for that camera. As well
  as adding audio encoding.

- New MPEG4 video encoder support is added.

- New menu items are added to start/stop either or both primary
  and secondary recording for every camera.

SDK
---

- The APIs for handling of regions is completely changed. The new
  APIs allow handling of unlimited regions even though currently
  we only support 4 regions. All the APIs associated to motion 
  detection blind and privacy is changed. Three new APIs 
  sdvr_add_region(), sdvr_change_region(), sdvr_remove_region() are
  added. Three API sdvr_set_motion_detection(), 
  sdvr_set_blind_detection(), sdvr_set_privacy_regions() are removed.

- Structure sdvr_chan_def_t is changed to support secondary video 
  encoder, audio encoding, and vpp_mode when creating a new encoder 
  channel.
- sdvr_enable_encoder(), sdvr_set_video_encoder_channel_params(), 
  sdvr_get_video_encoder_channel_params(), 
  sdvr_set_alarm_video_encoder_params(), 
  sdvr_get_alarm_video_encoder_params() take a new parameter to 
  specify the primary or secondary encoder.

- Multiple DVR board support.

- Sturcture sdvr_video_enc_chan_params_t was changed to support 
  MPEG4 video encoder.

- Two new video standard SDVR_VIDEO_STD_QCIF_PAL and 
  SDVR_VIDEO_STD_QCIF_NTSC support is added.

- Two new video size SDVR_VIDEO_SIZE_176x144 and 
  SDVR_VIDEO_SIZE_176x120 support is added.

- New frame type support for MPEG4 was added. SDVR_FRAME_MPEG4_I,
  SDVR_FRAME_MPEG4_P, SDVR_FRAME_MPEG4_B, and SDVR_FRAME_MPEG4_VOL.
  Note: When calculating the frame rate, you should not count 
  SDVR_FRAME_MPEG4_VOL frames.

- Frame type SDVR_FRAME_VIDEO_ENCODED is changed to 
  SDVR_FRAME_VIDEO_ENCODED_PRIMARY and a new frame type 
  SDVR_FRAME_VIDEO_ENCODED_SECONDARY are added.
  This change affects your A/V callback routine. See
  documentation of sdvr_set_av_frame_callback() for a usage
  example.

Limitations for this release
----------------------------

- Audio playback is not supported. The recorded .MOV files can be
  played back in Quicktime or any other standard player for audio
  playback.

- Audio output is not supported.

- sdvr_stream_raw_audio() is not functional in this release. This
  API function must not be called.

- G711 ULAW is the only audio encoder that is currently supported.

- Up to four regions are now supported for motion detection, privacy
  blocking etc. The demo application however does not provide a way
  to create these regions. The SDK API is fully functional.

- The video preprocessor (VPP) now has two modes, prefiltering and
  analytics. In prefilter mode all the analytics are disabled. The
  demo application always sets the mode to prefiltering. Both modes
  are available through the SDK API.

- Up to eight encoder or decoder instances can be created on any one
  processor. However performance will depend on the resolution and
  frame rate selected.

- sdvr_set_channel_default() is not supported in this release due to
  firmware limitations. This function must not be called. Calling it
  can cause the firmware to corrupt the encoder parameters.

Changes in release 2.1
----------------------

This release implements pre-filtering for video encoding.
This improves the quality of the encoding and reduces the
bit rates compared to the previous release. Pre-filtering
is enabled by default when motion detection is disabled.
When motion detection is enabled, pre-filtering is turned
off.

The recommended encoder settings for 16 channel operation
are : constant quality mode, quality level 100, gop 30,
max bit rate 2200 Kbps.

    The source code for this application is located in:
          host\apps\sdvr_diag

    The binary is located in:
          host\bin\windows\Release\sdvr_diag.exe

   Usage:

       sdvr_diag <board_index> <diag_fw>

   Where:
       board_index: The nth PCIe DVR board installed on your PC. Currently
                    this value is always 1. The valid range is 1 - 4;

       diag_fw:     The path to the romable diagnostics firmware.  


E. SDK
------

1.  The function sdvr_create_chan() was changed to accept only to 
    parameters. A pointer to structure which contains all the old 
    parameters as an input parameter. A pointer to sdvr_chan_handle_t 
    type to contain the channel handle as ouput parameter.
   
2.  The function sdvr_upgrade_firmware() is functional.

3.  The function sdvr_run_diagnostics() is functional.

3.  Linux is not supported.

4.  Alarms are not supported for MJPEG encoding.

5.  Double-byte characters and Unicode are not supported for OSD display
    and for SDK error messages.

6.  No video post-processing features are available for decoded video.

7.  Audio is not supported.

Errata for H.264 decoder
------------------------

1. In the player properties, the video resolution must be set to
   match the camera's recording resolution. i.e. if the file was
   recorded using 4CIF_NTSC, then the player must also be set to be
   4CIF_NTSC. This will be handled automatically in the next release.

2. A camera and a player must not be connected to the same "port"
   on the board. i.e. if camera 1 is connected to input 1, then no
   player should be connected to #1 on the board. This restriction
   will be removed in a later release.

3. If you disconnect a player and reconnect it to a different port,
   the demo app should be shut down and restarted before attempting
   to use the player.

4. The H.264 decoder does not run at full speed. If you attempt to run
   three or more decoders on one S6, they will not be able to run at full
   frame rate. Two encoders and two decoders on one S6 will also not run
   at full frame rate.

5. If the decoded output is scaled down for viewing, the decoder will
   slow down further.
