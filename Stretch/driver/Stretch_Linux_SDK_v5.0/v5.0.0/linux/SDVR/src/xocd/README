- Use XOCD version 7.0.1 or later. The latest supported version can be
  obtained from the Stretch customer portal.

- After XOCD is installed, copy the appropriate topology file from here
  into the XOCD directory and rename it to "topology.xml".

- If you are using the ByteTools Catapult EJ-1 Ethernet JTAG probe, edit
  the topology file and set the probe's IP address in the 'ipaddr' field.
  The Catapult Installation and Quick Start Guide explains how to set up
  the probe and discover its IP address.

- Run XOCD. Make sure to unblock the program if there is a firewall
  enabled, else you will not be able to connect to it.

- To verify, run st-gdb and type "target remote <xocd_server>:20000"
  where <xocd_server> is the name or IP address of the machine where
  XOCD is running, and 20000 is the port number. You should be able
  to connect to the processor and examine its registers.

- Ports 20000 - 20003 connect to the s6scp processors, and ports
  20004 - 20007 connect to the s6aux processors. That is, port 20000
  connects to the s6scp in the first (master) S6, port 20001 connects
  to the s6scp in the second S6, and so on.

- Set up the Stretch IDE to connect to XOCD as described in the IDE
  documentation.
