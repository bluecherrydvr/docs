    PACKAGE: Stretch Communication Toolkit (SCT) for S6D1X16

    DESCRIPTION:

    SECTION: Usage
    {
    #include "sct-board.h"
    }

    SECTION: Introduction

    The Stretch Communication Toolkit (SCT) for S6D1X16 supports the exchange
    of bulk data and control information between Windows applications and
    application running on Stretch S6D1X16 PCIe boards.  The block transfer
    of data uses the concept of "channels" while control information exchange
    is supported via "messages".

    The SCT for S6D1X16 must be run in conjunction with the SCT for Windows
    module on the Windows host machine.  SCT is implemented as a library for
    both S6D1X16 and Windows, but the Windows side also requires a custom
    Windows driver to complete the SCT module.
    
    The S6D1X16 board contains 4 Stretch processors (or Processor Entity, PE)
    configured in a 2x2 array.  PE0 is the master PE and is the only PE with a
    PCIe interface connected to the Windows host system, thus all SCT channel
    and message data must pass through PE0.

    Only application tasks on PE0 can actually use the SCT API.  Application
    tasks on remote PEs must use the SCPA API to interface with the SCT API,
    to communicate with the Windows applications over the PCIe interface.  To
    reduce complexity, application tasks on PE0 should also use the SCPA API to
    interface to the SCT API, with only certain dedicated PE0 task or tasks
    using the SCT API directly.

    Multiple S6D1X16 boards can be plugged into a Window host machine.  A
    single Windows application can control more than one board concurrently.
    However, multiple Windows applications cannot share the same board.  In
    other words, each board can only interact with a single Windows application.

    The SCT API for S6D1X16 and Windows support the same functions, but are
    not completely symmetric with each other.  To allow a Windows application
    to access multiple boards, the Windows-side API uses a "board handle" to
    identify a particular board and needs extra board-specific control routines.
    Other implementation requirements have also resulted in some differences
    between the APIs.


    SECTION: Assumptions

    This implementation assumes that the PCI Aperture Space will be mapped to
    a range of PCI addresses that is sufficient to cover all possible Windows
    buffers so that remapping will not be required.

    This implementation also assumes that Windows-side buffers will be
    contiguous so that only one DMA will be required per buffer.


    SECTION: Channels

    The board and Windows SCT applications must each call the sct_init()
    function to allocate resources and sync up with each other before the rest
    of the SCT channel and message API can be used.

    An SCT channel is used to transfer bulk data.  Each channel is
    uni-directional, allowing only one side to send.  A channel is created when
    a sender connects and the receiver accepts.  To terminate a channel
    connection, the sender closes the channel first.  The receiver can only
    close the channel after checking that the channel has been closed by the
    sender.  There are a limited number of connections per board. The current
    limit is 64.

    SCT supports management of data buffers but does not actually allocate or
    free any internally.  Data buffers on the board side are allocated by the
    board application tasks, which may be running on any PE.  Data buffers on
    the Host side are accessed by the board using pointers sent by the Host to
    the board.  The SCT handler for windows interrupts translates the pointers
    from PCI addresses into PCI Aperture Space addresses and either stores them
    in a free list or passes them to specific SCT channels, depending on whether
    the buffers are for send or receive.  For send channels, all channels pull
    from the same free list of pointers to empty Host buffers.  For receive
    channels, the buffers already contain data destined for a specific channel,
    so are passed on to the channel.

    SCT supports the protocol for data transfer with the Windows driver, but
    does not actually perform the data transfers between the board and Windows.
    The data transfers are left up to the application tasks, which will use
    the SCPA API to initiate the tranfers.  For more details on how to use the
    SCPA API, please see the SCPA API documentation.

    @NOTE@:  SCPA running on PE0 will transfer data to/from PCIe using
    dedicated PCIe DMA channels.  SPCA running on remote PEs will transfer
    data using NI DMA channels, which will go through the NB interface.  These
    transfers are no longer DMAs at the PCIe interface.  This results in a
    performance hit for buffer transfers from remote PEs.

    Writing (sending) side API's:
    {
        err = sct_chan_connect(port, buf_size, &channel);
        p   = sct_chan_tx_getbuf(channel);
        SCPA API calls transfer data;
        sct_chan_tx_send(channel, p, size);
        sct_chan_close(channel);
    }
    Note that sct_chan_tx_send() is only "send" and not "send and putbuf".  The
    buffer cannot automatically be returned to the free list.  It is up to the
    Host to give free buffers to back to the board.

    sct_chan_tx_getbuf() blocks if no Windows buffers are available for sending.

    Reading (receiving) side API's:
    {
        channel = sct_chan_accept(port);
        channel = sct_chan_rx_poll(channels);   // call is optional here
        p = sct_chan_rx_recv(channel, &size);
        SCPA API calls to transfer data;
        sct_chan_rx_putbuf(channel);
    }
    Note that sct_chan_rx_recv() is really "getbuf and recv".

    sct_chan_rx_recv() blocks until a Windows buffer for the given channel is
    available.  sct_chan_rx_poll() polls the channels in an array and returns
    the first channel which has data available.  sct_chan_rx_poll() never
    blocks, instead returning an indication that no channel has data available.

    SECTION: Windows Buffer Usage

    When the Windows driver starts, it allocates DMA buffers in kernel memory.
    For buffer sends from board to Windows, the Windows driver sends all the
    buffer pointers during SCT initialization, before any channels are created.
    The board firmware translates these addresses from PCI bus addresses to
    addresses in the S6 PCI Aperture Space, and stores them in a free list.
    If SCT supports two different buffer sizes, two different free lists are
    needed.  The board firmware pulls from a free list for each
    sct_chan_tx_getbuf() call by the board-side application.  After the buffer
    is sent by the application, it calls sct_chan_tx_send() and the buffer
    pointer is returned to Windows.  The Windows driver can recycle or send new
    buffer pointers to the board at any time, and the board firmware will
    replenish its free list.

    For buffer receive, the Windows driver sends a pointer to the Windows-side
    buffer.  The board firmware translates the address to a PCI aperture
    address, then stores in in a per-channel recv list.  When the board-side
    application calls sct_chan_rx_recv() for a channel, the first buffer in the
    channel's recv list is returned.  When the application is done with the
    buffer, it calls sct_chan_rx_putbuf(), and the board returns the pointer
    to Windows.

    Each SCT channel keeps track of the buffer pointers it has returned to the
    board firmware when sct_chan_tx_getbuf() or sct_chan_rx_recv() is called.
    Each channel can only store SCT_MAX_APP_OWNED_BUFFERS pointers, so whenever
    the board firmware is still holding this many buffers, sct_chan_tx_getbuf()
    or sct_chan_rx_recv() will return NULL.  Calling sct_chan_tx_send() or
    sct_chan_tx_putbuf() will release tx buffers to the SCT channel and calling
    sct_chan_rx_putbuf() will release rx buffers to the SCT channel.

    Each SCT receive channel can receive and store up to SCT_MAX_RECV_BUFFERS
    from the Host, which are then passed to the board firmware when it calls
    sct_chan_rx_recv().  If the application does not call sct_chan_rx_recv()
    with enough frequency, the receive channel can back up.  At that point,
    the channel will stop receiving new buffers and will return any incoming
    buffers to the Host with an error code.

    SECTION: Messages

    Messages are single point-to-point packets from the Windows application to
    the board and vice versa.  Broadcast or multicast messages are not
    supported.  Messages are intended to be the "control" channel for
    Windows application-board application communication (in contrast to
    channels which are the "data" paths). They are expected to be sent and
    received relatively infrequently and to be used for small blocks of data.
    A typical example might be passing a command from the Windows application   
    to the board to set the board into a new mode.

    A message is a 16-byte block of data.  There is no support for longer
    messages or variable length messages.  It is assumed that the sender
    and receiver agree on the data format of the message.

    The message is delivered reliably and in-order.  However, note that if
    the receiver is not actively reading and responding to received messages,
    that the network can "back-up" with messages.

    Each message has a specified class, which is an integer between 0 and 127.
    The purpose of the message class is to allow the receiver of a message to
    infer type information on the message based on the message class or to
    organize the messages by message class.

    A message is sent using sct_message_send(), which specifies the
    destination, the message class, a buffer containing the message, and the
    size of the buffer.

    A message is received by the application using sct_message_recv().
    sct_message_recv() has blocking semantics.  There is also a nonblocking
    version, sct_message_recv_poll().  sct_message_recv() allows filtering
    of the messages based on the "class" field, if an application is trying
    in receive messages of a specific class.


    SECTION: Message Example

    {
        sx_uint8 msg_buffer[SCT_MAX_MESSAGE_LEN];
        sx_uint8 msg_class;

        // receive message, any class
        sct_message_recv(-1, &msg_buffer, NULL, &msg_class );
        
        // handle message based on class
        switch(msg_class) {
        case 0:
            pmessage0 = (void *) buffer;
            .
            .
            .
            break;

        case 1:
            pmessage1 = (void *) buffer;
            .
            .
            .
            break;

        default:
            break;
        }
    }
