Initial size of virtual buffer is half of maximum buffer size.

QP change depends on current size of virtual buffer.
40~60% -> QP Not Change
30~40%, 60~70% -> Slow Change (+- 1)
20~30%, 70~80% -> Medium Change (+- 2)
10~20%, 80~90% -> Fast Change (+- 3)
0~10%, 90~100% -> Fastest Change (+- 4)

Average frame size of I frame is...
QP is less than 5             : BPS /FPS
QP is equal or greater than 5 : BPS *GOP *2 /FPS /(GOP +1)

Average frame size of P frame is...
QP is less than 5             : BPS /FPS
QP is equal or greater than 5 : BPS *GOP /FPS /(GOP +1)

(BPS : Bit Per Sec)
(GOP : Size of Group of Picture)
(FPS : Frames per Second)

If size of current frame is equal or greater than 4 times of average frame size, regardless of virtual buffer status, add 1 to QP.
If size of current frame is equal or less than quarter times of average frame size, regardless of virtual buffer status, subtract 1 from QP.
