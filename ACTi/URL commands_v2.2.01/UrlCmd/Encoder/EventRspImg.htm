<h2>EVENT_RSPIMG1, EVENT_RSPIMG2, EVENT_RSPIMG3</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>Get or Set the video image engine of the event configurations.</p>
	<p>
    	When event source is triggered, the device could upload the video image or video clip to the SMTP mail server, FTP server or the HTTP CGI program.
    </p>
	<p>
    	The video still image was made by using snapshot technique. The image size is the same as the streaming video resolution and not configurable.
        The extend file name of the video still image is *.jpg.
    </p>
	<p>
    	The video clip is the raw data of the video stream.
        The specific header will be inserted in the head of raw data to allow the specific player could play it.
        The extend file name of the video clip is *.raw.
    </p>
	<p>
    	To upload video still images to the SMTP mail server, the SMTP mail server configurations have to be set first.
        Refer to the URL <a href="SmtpServer.htm">SMTP_PRI</a> and <a href="SmtpServer.htm">SMTP_SEC</a> for further information.
    </p>
	<p>
    	To upload the video still images or video clip to the FTP server, the FTP server configurations have to be ser first.
        Refer to the URL <a href="FtpServer.htm">FTP_SERVER</a> for further information.
    </p>
	<p>
    	Currently, upload video still image to SMTP mail server and upload video still image or video clip to FTP server are available.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The upload time should be smaller than the repeat time if the event source is SCH.
        If the upload time is larger than the repeat time, the device will use the repeat time as the time base to handel the image upload in this case.
        The upload time is not used then. Refer to EVENT_CONFIG URL.

	<p>
    	<strong>PreBuf</strong>: the time in seconds before the event source was triggered. It could be 0, 1, 2 or 3 seconds.
        It does not guarantee to have video with precise timing control. And it is only valid for type 4~7.
        For still image upload, this argument has to fixed to 0.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>UploadTime</strong>: the time in seconds to upload video to the remote server when the event source was triggered.
        It could be from 0 to 86400. If it is 0, the video upload will be stopped as the event source becomes inactive.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ImageRate</strong>: the frame rate of the still image. It was not used and has to be fixed to 0.
        For uploading still images, the device will do its best effort to snapshot the video image for uploading until the UploadTime is expired or event source
        becomes inactive (UploadTime is 0). For uploading video clip, this argument is not used and has to be fixed to 0.
        The frame rate of the video clip is the same frame rate in streaming mode.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ImageName</strong>: the prefix of file name of the video still image or video clip. The postfix of the file name could be decoded
        by <a href="PostfixNamingRule.htm">the rule of postfix naming rule</a>. The first character of this value has not to be '%'.
        The maximum length is 63.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>UploadPath</strong>: the prefix of the upload path of the video still image or video clip. The postfix of the file name could be decoded
        by <a href="PostfixNamingRule.htm">the rule of postfix naming rule</a>. The first character of this value has not to be '%'.
        The maximum length is 63.<br>
        <br>
      <strong>HostUrl</strong>: The destination host address. It depends on the value in type argument. The maximum length is 63.

	<p>
    	<strong>subject</strong>: The subject of the mail. This is only used if the type is 1. It was not used in another type.
        The character in the subject has to follow RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier Generic Syntax. The maximum length is 31.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>VideoSrc</strong>: This is used of dual stream platform. For PlatformA it is fixed to 1.
        In Dual Streams Platform, it indicates which video stream is used for uploading video images. The 1 is for video stream 1 and 2 is for video stream 2.
  If the length of the input argument is longer than its maximum length limitation, the error message will be returned. </p>
