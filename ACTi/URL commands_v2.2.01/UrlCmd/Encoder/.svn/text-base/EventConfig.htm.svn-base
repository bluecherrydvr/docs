<h2>EVENT_CONFIG</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>Set an event handler entry in the event handler configuration table or read all entries from event handler configuration table.</p>
	<p>
    	There are 10 entries in the event handler configuration table. Every entry connects a specific event source to one or more event outputs.
        The event outputs will link to the their output configurations and external servers to process their tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
    	For platformT camera, there is one default-enabled event rule in the last entry of event handler configuration table.
        This rule could switch the video day/night profile based on the day/night state in the camera. This rule could be disabled
        if people do not want to have this function.
    </p>
	<p>
    	If there is no input argument, the device will dump all entries configurations from event handler configuration table.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Input Argument</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>
entry,state,wday,sHH:SMM,dHH:dMM,EventSrc,EventOutput[,RepeatTime]<br>
		where<br>
        <strong>entry</strong>: the index of the entry in the event handler configuration table. It is from 0 ~ 9 where 0 is the first entry of the table.<br>
        <strong>state</strong>: 0:Disable, 1:Enable. If it is disable, this event entry will not be used.<br>
    <strong>wday</strong>: the valid weekday of the events. Here is the format of wday. </p>

        	Example<br>
            wday=1237 means the event will be active in every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday<br>
            wday=1234567 means the event will be active everyday.<br>
            wday=76421 means the event will be active in every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. That is the same as wday=12467.
        </p>
		<p>
       	<strong>sHH:sMM</strong>: It gives the starting time of a day specified in the wday argument. sHH is from 00~23 and sMM is from 00~59. </p>
        <p>
            <strong>dHH:dMM</strong>: it give the duration started from sHH:sMM of a day specified in the wday argument.
            The range of the dHH and dMM depends on the wday and sHH:sMM.
            The principle to setup the schedule rule of these arguments is the active event time should not be overlapped.<br>
			Example<br>
<br>
        	wday,sHH,sMM,dHH,dMM=135,20:00,06:00 means the active event time is from 20:00 to 23:59 in every Monday, Wednesday, Friday
        	and 00:00~02:00 in every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.</br>
        	wday,sHH,sMM,dHH,dMM=1,00:00,48:00 means the active event time is from 00:00 every Monday to 00:00 every Thursday.

        	The '|' is used to connect different Event Output's.<br>
            Example:<br>
            DO1|DO2. The DO1 and DO2 levels will be updated based on event condition.<br>
            MSG1|DO1. The DO1 levels will be updated and message will be issues based on EVENT_RSPIMG1 settings when the event source is triggered.</p>
  <p><strong>RepeatTime</strong>: The repeat timer in minutes form 0 to 1440. This is only used when the EventSrc=SCH. If this argument is missed in the EventSrc=SCH, there is no repeat timer in the event and the repeat timer is set to 0. Otherwise, the repeat timer will be applied to this event rule.<br>
    If the RepeatTime is 0. the event is triggered during the active event time interval.<br>
    The upload time should be smaller than this repeat time if the output of event is uploading image/video to remote servers. If the upload timer is equal to or larger than the repeat time, the event is always triggered during the effective event time interval. The image rate will be calculated by this repeat time. The upload time will not be used then.<br>
  Example<br>
  0,1,1234567,00:00,24:00,SCH,IMG1,5 : perform upload image/video defined on EVENT_RSPIMG1 every 5 minutes all the time.<br>
  0,1,1234567,00:00,24:00,SCH,IMG1 : perform upload image/video defined on EVENT_RSPIMG1 all the time</p>
