This is GPL software. Do with it as you want, but feed us back any improvements.

This is a simple commmand line utility to control a PELCO PTZ camera via RS422/485
'P' protocol. It supports all of the commands including UP, DOWN, IN, OUT, LEFT,
RIGHT, NEAR, FAR, as well as the memory JUMP commands. 

To use this, you need to put a RS232->RS422 adapter on the output
of your desired serial port.  I use a B&B Electronics model 422LP9R (www.blackbox.com).

The Pelco doesn't return ANY usefull info back, so you only really need 2-wire support 
(one way) communications out.  However, the software needs to know when the last bit has left 
the shift register, and so you have to loop the output back around to the input.  This
way, when you have read what you have written, you know that your timing will be right.


Have fun.
